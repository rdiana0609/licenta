0_1,1,"Edit: Can't flair, as on mobile.I'm just frustrated right now. I'm sixteen, and my BMI is somewhere around 17.6, I think, and my mom has started to make comments about me being the same size as my best friend, and me being skinny. She just kind of does it in either a disparaging/worried way, or she looks at me like she's jealous that I can fit into things that she can't, and I think she's torn between resenting me and being worried about me. She also makes comments about my eating habits, as in that I only eat specific foods most of the time, and I have a somewhat mono-diet. What frustrates me is that I feel I can't ever do anything which is good enough for her; I always struggled with my weight over the years, which was odd, because she was so healthy and she has custody of my brother and I, and I think me being chubby was always a source of disappointment to her. She literally told me last week that the prettier I am, the happier she is – is that a normal thing to say to your teenage daughter? Don't get me wrong, I love my mom, and she has many, many redeeming qualities, but there has always been this issue, for as long as I can remember.I don't know. I guess I'm just here to rant. Also, I use restricting as a means to cope with bulimia (i.e. If I restrict I won't purge, because I feel I'm in control) which she knew about, and never did anything to help me with. I do want to eventually up my calories so I have energy for gym again and just general life-living, but I feel I want to be as skinny as possible first? But I also don't know if/when I can stop, and it's confusing, and hard to deal with on my own. Thanks for reading, if you made it down here."
1_1,1,i am trying not to eat.
3_1,1,I was fasting all day and had to break it at dinner because my friends insisted on me eating out with them. How to get around this? It's happened every day for the last three days and I'm getting depressed because of it.
4_1,1,"I'm stuck at home for spring break. Which means my mom is dead set on cooking my favorite dinners every night. I had 100 calories during the day today, but now it's 6:30 and I've already eaten a ton of chips and guacamole that she made me, and we haven't even started actual dinner which is chicken and dumplings soup. I had to purge some of the guac and now adding in this soup with the amount she expects me to eat I'll just barely be under my TDEE I estimate. I feel so hungry all day and sick when I purge but I'm not even losing and fucking weight to make it worth it. "
6_1,1,"ive been sick for almost a week and have been using it as an excuse to eat whatever. now im finally getting over it, but now my teeth hurt from coughing so much, so im living off of my low calorie juices and tea.I so rarely just cant eat, I can always find an excuse to and it leads to binging of course. now im actually hoping this cough last a few days. im terrible.p.s. being so sick im nearly dry heaving has taught me I truly cant make myself purge."
8_1,1,"he thinks he has ""gained"" because his face isn't as gaunt... I do agree, but contend it TOTALLY could all just be bloat from all the salty food he has been eating after doing his usual not-quite-restricting (because of course, he doesn't have a problem...HA yes neither of us does...HA) He was poking at his ribs and trying to tell me it must be fat gain because bloat doesn't happen between ribs. Aw poor guy, seriously. I try to be consoling and spout off things I've read here that helps me when I'm feeling like I want to ignore the eating disorder voiceAnyway Let's all try to be nicer to ourselves. I'll be deleting this later"
9_1,1,"About 2 months ago I fully accepted I had a problem with binging and purging and decided I needed to do something about it. First, I altogether stopped purging (unfortunately the binging remained) for two weeks and I gained 7 pounds in that short time. I thought I'd be ok with some weight gain. Nope nope nope. Then I started purging again. Now it's worse than ever. I purge as much as I can, usually 3 times per week. That sounds relatively low, but there's one saving grace: I physically can't purge more than about 2 days in a row. After that it is impossible, or almost so. Realizing that I'm just maintaining my weight, I contacted a therapist to try to get help. I had my first meeting this morning. One of the first ways she said to resolve this cycle was by drawing it out and showing me the first thing I need to eliminate: purging. ""Fuck that,"" I thought as I smiled dead-eyed to her face. She told me that weight gain was most likely for obvious reasons. And that's when I tuned the hell out. I realized that I only went to therapy because I (for lack of a better way to put it) want to be able to **still** purge as a backup, but get rid of the binges, which would lead me to a much, much lower (and probably unhealthy) weight. So for now, my stomach grumbles and I push on, hoping that one day my brain and body can be in sync. "
11_1,1,Obviously you still absorb/ingest calories from chewing and spitting...
12_1,1,"I get kinda dizzy and woozy sometimes while fasting, and was wondering what your go-to safe things that help are.. I usually go for a cup of apple juice but I'm not a huge fan of the amount of sugar that has. What are your go-tos? Not extremely filling, but help so you don't pass out."
13_1,1,"i've been repeating a lot of the same excuses when people offer me food and i was hoping you guys could help me out!-i already ate earlier when I was out/home-i'm allergic/lactose intolerant-my brother really likes x, i'll save some for him-i don't really like x-i feel kind of sick right now, i don't feel like eating-i'm fasting for a doctor's appointmentwhat are some of your go-to excuses??"
14_1,1,"On mobile, tag as rant/rave please. So this weekend I fasted Friday and Saturday. Sunday I woke up feeling pretty horrible, feverish and worn down. I drank a bunch of water and still didn't feel better. I planned on having dinner with my mom, but tried to eat something small to start feeling better. Instead, I mini binged. I didn't want to purge because I didn't feel that great to begin with. But I ended up purging anyway. Then repeated mini binge/purge a couple hours later. Then had dinner with my mom and purged that too. Today I feel so shitty, I used to b/p every day years ago but haven't had a day like yesterday in a long time. I had some oatmeal and an apple for breakfast because I had a physiology test today. I just want to lay in bed and sleep my life away right now. I kind of feel like I'm losing it today and I can't tell anyone that. I'm sorry this post is so pointless, I just feel like I'm falling apart and needed to say it to someone. "
15_1,1,"I'm not talking about our thoughts on our bodies or depression and insecurity. I'm specifically talking about hunger and cravings and thoughts of food. I'm pretty miserable both when restricting and now, at 12-1300 calories. I just want to be able to eat what I want!  I want to eat what I want...but I also want to be thin. I know a lot of you have done this for long enough that you don't mind it...but I think about food every second of my life, even if I'm not restricting. I just crave delicious foods. I can't accept that I will NEVER get to eat them without having to go hungry before or after. If I can't do it forever, I wonder if it's worth being miserable over. I am 108 lbs today. I've not lost weight in 2 weeks. I work a 12 hr shift with a girl who is so thin. I watched her eat 600 calories during this period and she was perfectly full. Me however ate the same but was thinking about eating more the entire 12 hrs. "
16_1,1,"I eat about 1500 calories daily, but I feel like I'm overeating. Guess I'm just going crazy lol."
17_1,1,Actually 3900. Shit. And we are supposed to go out this Friday to a place I'm just going to log as 2000 cause its all bad for you and I have to eat or my boyfriend will be sad. I just don't know what to do. In order to balance out these two binges I can't eat more than 150 calories a day and I feel so sick from not eating right now. Any advice is welcome. I just want to lay down. My body hurts so bad.
18_1,1,"...and I'm very apprehensive because I won't have my scale tonight and will be forced to eat with people. Generally, I feel safe with this person but this is the first I have really dealt with this since coming into my relapse. Any advice? :(Apologies for no flair, on mobile"
19_1,1,"Hi everyone, I've been a long time lurker but I never had the guts to write. Hope you don't mind strangers dropping in. I have struggled with binge eating for as long as I can remember. Lately I've been so good and I've been fasting for 7 days straight (I did have a 300 cal meal on day 3 and today) and I lost 9,8 pounds so far this month. But today I can feel the binge coming, and I don't know if I can resist it this time. All I want is to shove my face in some burgers and fries. I don't know what to do."
20_1,1,"I fasted for 17 hours, and I decided to break the fast with a banana, 12g of dark chocolate, and a cup of black coffee. That all together amounts to under 200 calories, and with dinner, I'd be at roughly 700 calories for the day.Then I decided to open the fridge. Bad idea. I had a ham sandwich.  I had 4 dough balls with garlic butter dip. Then I had a chocolate croissant. Then I had 5 chocolate cookies. All that amounts to 808 calories.But you know what, guys? I'm not feeling discouraged. I reminded myself of my goal, that I have 7 days to lose at least 2 pounds. Sure, I feel shit and my stomach feels bloated as fuck, but I'm going to burn off as much as I can without making myself ill.I'm just happy that I managed to stop myself before things escalated. I can do this. *I can do this.*EDIT: Decided to tackle the calories; 700 jumping jacks, 80 squats, 5 min wall sit and half a mile walk - I'd say that's better than crying into a pillow like I'd usually do."
21_1,1,anyone here deal with this as well? i decided to eat maintenance today and even though im quite full right now i feel this super overwhelming desire to eat. i dont wanna give in and gain today
22_1,1,"So I can't do a 24 hour fast... yet, but I figured that I can fast during the night + some hours in the morning and afternoon. I was wondering if anyone else does this and what the results are. Edit: on mobile can't flair "
23_1,1,"I was in hospitalized for 17 days at 121 pounds (I'm 5'7) and now I'm in a partial program, both said the goal was for me to maintain and be healthy but I recently found where my mum hid the scale and stupidly weighed myself. 130 fucking pounds.... I don't want to eat and I surely don't want to keep doing this.. I don't know what to do anymore"

193_0,0,Thought I had fallen off the wagon but nope!
3737_1,0,1 prepare yourself psychologically3
3738_1,0,2 stay hydrated3
3739_1,0,we all are aware of anorexia nervosa as a disturbing eating disorder that is observed mostly in teenagers
3740_1,0, the people suffering from this disorder experience significant weight loss as they purposely withhold themselves from eating food
3741_1,0," even when the mirror shows that they are thin, they have the perception of being fat and thus try to take very fewer calories"
3742_1,0,this condition can be linked to psychological disorders like depression and low self-esteem
3743_1,0,"usually, people have a misconception that people on an anorexic diet do not eat at all, but the truth is that they are on a diet extremely low in calories"
3744_1,0, these patients start by fasting in the initial days followed by a diet plan extremely low in calories
3745_1,0,"according to the eating disorders association, the most probable person to become anorexic is girls of 10-19 years of age"
3746_1,0," but at the same time, boys are also facing eating disorder"
3747_1,0, the trend usually begins from celebrities who are always under the camera and are judged by people for their appearance
3748_1,0, therefore today almost everyone who is conscious about their weight and body is vulnerable to become anorexic
3749_1,0," and with the right diet plan, one can easily achieve it"
3752_1,0, it is that diet plan which is reportedly favored by various hollywood celebrities including jennifer aniston
3754_1,0," yes, you heard that right"
3755_1,0, those little jars filled with pureed food can be considered as one meal or a snack for you
3756_1,0, but make sure that you do not consume more than one container
3758_1,0,but stay clear of alcoholic beverages and coffee
3759_1,0, you can ingest water repeatedly after the snack
3765_1,0, the overall concept of this diet plan is simple
3771_1,0," apart from this, you should include vitamin supplements, and some source of protein, maybe a protein drink or a protein bar which has zero fat in your diet plan"
3778_1,0,just follow the given process
3781_1,0," it may sound funny, but we are serious"
3783_1,0,and so you can include a lot of water in your diet
3784_1,0, but stay away from aerated drinks like soda
3785_1,0, it should not be part of your diet
3786_1,0, whatever drinks you include should be just low in calories and sugar
3787_1,0,anorexia is no less than a threat to the life of an individual
3788_1,0, but you can still achieve it without endangering your health
3790_1,0,hunger is a natural psychological need of human and so we are prone to overeating
3791_1,0, many times we don’t even know when to stop
3794_1,0,often we cannot differentiate between hunger and thirst
3795_1,0," most of the time when we get dehydrated, we take food instead of fluids"
3798_1,0,change in the diet plan and exercise will only be effective if it is not carried out the right way
3800_1,0," implement the right diet plan, get a constant medical control, keep a diary of your meals, and if required consult a nutritionist"
3801_1,0," but remember, starvation is not the right way , so never go that way"
3802_1,0,"that’s it, guys"
3804_1,0," we sincerely hope that you don’t really need to use these plans, but if you really need it we would suggest you undertake any of these diet plans under medical help"
3805_1,0, eat healthily and stay healthy
